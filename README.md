### **📸 Capture Experiment (Homework)**

A group-based object capture study evaluating how lane paint contrast and clarity vary in:

* **Lighting:** Bright sunlight, dim light, shadows, harsh backlight
* **Resolution:** Normal vs high-res smartphone mode
* **Motion:** Still frame vs motion blur
  Observations focus on color fidelity, edge sharpness, blur effects, and recognition difficulty for classical CV algorithms detecting high-contrast lane boundary markers.

### ** Mini-Project: Autonomous Vehicle Lane Detection**



Autonomous vehicle lane detection for perception in self-driving systems.
Implements gradient magnitude & direction computation from road frames using classical edge cues and lane markings.
Applies Sobel Operator and Canny Edge Detector to extract lane boundaries and object edges.
Highlights gradient computation as the core foundation for lane and obstacle perception in autonomous tasks.
